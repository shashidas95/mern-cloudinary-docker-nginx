## Project Description

The Cloudinary CRUD operations MERN stack application is a web project designed for efficient image management. It allows users to perform CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete) on images using the MERN (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js) stack. The application leverages Cloudinary, a cloud-based image management platform, for secure and streamlined image handling.

### Key Features

- CRUD operations for images
- MERN stack development
- Cloudinary integration for image management
- User-friendly interface built with React.js
- Efficient image storage and retrieval with MongoDB
- Streamlined image handling for web applications

## Why I chose this Project

I decided to work on the Cloudinary CRUD operations MERN stack application for several reasons. Firstly, it provided a hands-on opportunity to understand the practical aspects of image management in web applications. This project allowed me to enhance my skills in creating, updating, and deleting images—essential skills for a developer.

Additionally, the project aligns with industry trends by utilizing the MERN stack, a versatile and popular technology combination. Exploring this stack provided me with proficiency in a holistic development approach, covering both frontend and backend aspects.

Moreover, the integration of Cloudinary into the project allowed me to work with a powerful cloud-based image management solution. This enhanced my understanding of how cloud-based services can elevate application functionalities.

In essence, I chose the Cloudinary CRUD operations MERN stack project to gain practical experience in handling images within web applications, explore the MERN stack, and work with a prominent cloud-based image management solution like Cloudinary.

### Tech Stack Used

- MongoDB
- Express.js
- React.js
- Node.js
- Cloudinary

## Challenges Faced

During the development of the Cloudinary CRUD operations MERN stack application, a significant challenge was seamlessly integrating with Cloudinary for image management. This involved ensuring secure image uploads, tracking changes made to images, and efficiently managing resources.

Securely handling image uploads and accommodating various image formats and sizes added complexity. Additionally, accurately reflecting modifications or deletions to images in the Cloudinary database required meticulous attention to detail.

The challenge extended beyond technical aspects to considerations for user experience. Striking the right balance between functionality, security, and user-friendliness was crucial in overcoming this challenge and delivering a reliable image management system.

## Setup Guide

Follow these steps to set up and run the Cloudinary CRUD operations MERN stack application locally:

1. **Clone the Repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/doubtcrack/Cloudinary-CRUD-Operations.git
   cd Cloudinary-CRUD-Operations

   ```

2. **Installing Dependencies:**
   ```bash
    cd client
    npm install
    cd ../server
    npm install
   ```
3. **Setting Up `.env` Credentials**

   To enable seamless image management functionalities, you'll need Cloudinary API credentials, and for saving those images location and other data you will need mongodb url.

   Follow these steps:

   1. Obtain Cloudinary API & MongoDB credentials.
   2. Create a `.env` file in the `server` directory.
   3. Add your credentials to the `.env` file:

   ```env
   CLOUDINARY_CLOUD_NAME=your-cloud-name
   CLOUDINARY_API_KEY=your-api-key
   CLOUDINARY_API_SECRET=your-api-secret
   MONGO_URI=your-mongodb-uri
   ```

Create a `.env` file in your client directory and provide your live server URL

    REACT_APP_SERVER_URL= your-server-url

4. **Starting the Server**

   Start the server by running the following command in the server directory:

   ```
   cd server
   npm start
   ```

5. **Starting the Client**

   Begin the client application with the following command in the client directory:

   ```
   cd client
   npm start
   ```
